All flyers were given a purpose and the crow was left without one. He went to visit a bear and the bear spent weeks teaching him about medicine. The crow was still mad without having a purpose. One day he heard a squirrel crying in a hollow oak tree. He went to go see and saw the squirrel was sad about something.  He directed the squirrel to the bear, who was good with medicine. The next the day crow flew around satisfied with knowing that he had helped someone. He heard bunny crying in their burrow. He asked asked why and they said that they could never they could never get any peace with the fox always prying around. Then the crow stated the bunny's strengths of big ears and strong legs. Then word came around of crow's purpose of helping others find their purpose.
